# License information

For each file in this repo, share-alike distribution applies when possible:
- __if__ the file internally states that it has *licence X* (where X refers to any specific licence): *licence X* applies to that file
- __elseif__ the source website of the file states that it has *licence Y* (where Y refers to any specific licence): *licence Y* applies to that file. Note: source website can be contested, because there can be errors in automatic metadata extraction.
- __elseif:__ there is a `.source.json` for that file with non-null licence string: this licence applies to the document. Note: licence string can be contested, because there can be errors in automatic metadata extraction.
- __else:__ defaults to being
    - NOT open-licensed (not Creative Commons, MIT, etc.),
    - Not to be redistributed or used commercially, and
    - Stored here temporarily for review and potential removal or replacement.
