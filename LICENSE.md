# License information

## For the project as a whole

lunchSTEM can be used for any purpose (including commercial purposes), but lunchSTEM cannot be redistributed (for example: forking and sharing is not allowed) without explicit permission from us. 

Also, any project built on top of lunchSTEM (that uses lunchSTEM under the hood, for example, an MCP Server for lunchSTEM contents) can only be published/distributed by a third-party with our explicit permission.

## For the specific PDF files in this repo

For each PDF file in this repo, share-alike distribution applies when possible:
- __if__ the file internally states that it has *licence X* (where X refers to any specific licence): *licence X* applies to that file
- __elseif__ the source website of the file states that it has *licence Y* (where Y refers to any specific licence): *licence Y* applies to that file. Note: source website can be contested, because there can be errors in automatic metadata extraction.
- __elseif:__ there is a `.source.json` for that file with non-null licence string: this licence applies to the document. Note: licence string can be contested, because there can be errors in automatic metadata extraction.
- __else:__ defaults to being
    - NOT open-licensed (not Creative Commons, MIT, etc.),
    - Not to be redistributed or used commercially, and
    - Stored here temporarily for review and potential removal or replacement.
