Include others of similar standing; list is illustrative, not exhaustive.

### 2. Government & Intergovernmental Agencies
Typically high factual standards; check publication dates.

- NASA, ESA, JAXA, CNSA (space, astronomy)
- NIST (standards & measurements)
- NIH, CDC, WHO (health/biomedical)
- USGS, NOAA (earth & climate data)
- OECD, World Bank, UN (macro statistics)
- Eurostat, National statistical offices (official stats)

### 3. Standards & Professional Bodies
- IEEE, ACM, IETF (RFCs), W3C, ISO, ITU
- OpenJDK / Python / Rust / Linux kernel official documentation
- Unicode Consortium

### 4. Reputable Scientific & Technical Publishers
Peer‑reviewed or editorially rigorous venues. For cutting‑edge claims, confirm publication status (preprint vs peer reviewed).

- Nature family journals
- Science (AAAS)
- Cell, NEJM, Lancet (domain specific caution)
- PNAS
- ACM / IEEE conference proceedings (SIGCOMM, NeurIPS, ICML, CVPR, ACL, etc.)
- SIAM journals, Royal Society journals

Preprints (arXiv, bioRxiv) are useful but NOT automatically validated—treat as provisional unless widely replicated or cited.

### 5. Established Technical Documentation
Primary, versioned, official docs preferred.

- Vendor SDK & API docs (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP, OpenAI, NVIDIA)
- Language/toolchain docs (Python docs, Rust Book, C++ standard drafts, Go docs)
- Major framework docs (PyTorch, TensorFlow, React, Kubernetes)

### 6. Nonprofit / Foundation / Consortium Reports
Check methodology transparency.

- Mozilla Foundation, Apache Foundation
- Linux Foundation (CNCF, LF AI)
- OpenAI Research (treat frontier claims cautiously)
- Allen Institute (AI2), CERN, CERN Open Data

### 7. Big Tech Research & Engineering Blogs
Valuable for system design / implementation details. Marketing bias possible.

- Google Research, DeepMind
- Microsoft Research
- Meta AI Research (FAIR)
- OpenAI (research posts; double‑check benchmarks)
- NVIDIA Technical Blog
- Apple Machine Learning Research
- Amazon Science
- Netflix Tech Blog, Uber Engineering, Databricks Engineering, Stripe Engineering


## Source Reliability Criteria (Content-Level)
Content (even if not from a listed domain) may be treated as reasonably accurate if it has ANY of these reinforcing properties AND no red flags:

- Peer reviewed in a recognized venue (journal, top-tier conference)
- 3+ recognized authors with track records (citations, affiliations)
- Independently replicated results (multiple sources converging)
- Reproduced by a third-party
- Official specification or standard (final or accepted draft)
- High consensus across authoritative references (>= 3 independent reputable sources)
- Widely adopted open-source project documentation (active maintenance, many contributors/stars, issue resolution history)

Lower confidence signals (need corroboration): single-author blog/notes/slides, forum answers, unchecked preprints, vendor marketing whitepapers without methodology, AI‑generated pages, student notes, etc

## Maintenance of this list
- Review this list quarterly
- Track additions/removals with brief rationale in change log
- Encourage PRs adding respected sources

Change Log:
- 2025-08-25: Initial expanded draft

No source is infallible. This guide accelerates triage; it does not replace critical evaluation.
