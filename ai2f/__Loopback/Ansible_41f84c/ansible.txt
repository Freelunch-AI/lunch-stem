For target machines running Unix/Linux, a control machine:

opens an SSH session to the target node, performs basic preparations (e.g. creates temporary directories);

creates customised scripts (mostly Python) and transfers them using SFTP (default) or SCP (configurable) to the target;

finally it executes the scripts on the target host.

The process is repeated for each single task on each single host (Ansible can also be optimised to leave an open SSH session for multiple tasks).

In Ansible, basic units of work are coded in modules and specified in (called from) tasks.

For most modules the logic is written in Python. Whether a specific module uses external programs or not, the actions to be performed are wrapped in Python scripts.

One exception to the above is the raw module which executes the specific command directly in SSH session.

Another special case is the synchronize module which is executed on the control machine and uses rsync to transfer files.
