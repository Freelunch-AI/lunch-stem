Query Languages (e.g. SQL or GraphQL) are basically definining a protocol that goes inside
the application layer protocol. Examples:

SQL: defines a protocol for clients to interact with table databases, and this protocol goes inside the application protocol the database uses.
Example: backend gets data from /sends data to database server

GraphQL: defines a protocol for clients to interact with backend APIs, and this protocol is the HTTP payload
Example:  browser requests data from/posts data to a http server for some data.
