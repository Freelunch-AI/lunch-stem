#Key Learning Points

• Raw EEG waveforms and spectrogram patterns help characterize the neurophysiologic
properties of various anesthetics.
• Processed EEG monitoring has not been
shown to reduce the risk of awareness with
explicit recall (AWR) compared to end-tidal
anesthetic concentration (ETAC) monitoring
protocols.
• EEG-guided titration of anesthetic depth may
help to minimize the risk of cognitive dysfunction after surgery though multicenter trials are needed to confirm preliminary
findings.
• Various EEG markers are indicative of cerebral ischemia, and they tend to demonstrate
frequency slowing, decreased power and variability of faster frequencies, and increased
regional asymmetry.

#EEG Data Acquisition
and Interpretation

##Raw EEG

EEG now has diagnostic and prognostic
value for various neurologic conditions, such as
epilepsy [3], stroke [4], traumatic brain injury
[5], and brain death [6]

The clinical application of EEG has been
largely confined to the field of neurology, but
there is growing interest in the use of EEG for 
194
brain monitoring during anesthesia [8].

Targeted brain monitoring during anesthesia and
surgery may improve neurologic outcomes by
reducing the risk of intraoperative awareness
with explicit recall (AWR) and by enhancing
postoperative cognitive recovery. Further
research is needed to identify reliable EEG
markers that reflect level of consciousness and to
explore the ability of EEG to improve such perioperative neurologic outcomes. This approach
must begin, however, with a basic understanding
of the neurophysiologic effects of various anesthetics as reflected by the EEG. Thus, in this
chapter, we will review the anesthetic effects on
both raw and processed EEG data and then discuss the clinical utility of EEG for surgical
patients.

#Anesthetics

. As we will see
below, each anesthetic is associated with a specific pattern in both the raw EEG and corresponding spectrogram

propofol: At depths consistent with general anesthesia,
propofol predominantly displays alpha, delta,
and slow oscillations on the raw EEG (Fig. 11.3a).
On the corresponding spectrogram, high power is
demonstrated in these corresponding frequency
bandwidths (Fig. 11.3b)

Ether-based volatile
anesthetics : demonstrate a similar pattern on the raw
EEG, which is characterized by alpha, theta,
delta, and slow oscillations (Fig. 11.3a). On the
spectrogram, high power is demonstrated in these
bandwidths, often with more theta power compared to the propofol spectrogram

Halogenated ethers and propofol: share similar
neurophysiologic traits with non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep.
For example, coherent
oscillatory spindle activity is present with both
propofol sedation and NREM sleep, which is
believed to reflect a breakdown of thalamocortical processing [11–13]
wave oscillations are also noted during both sleep
and propofol anesthesia, which may represent
fragmented cortical connectivity

ketamine: Uniquely, ketamine anesthesia is associated
with increased beta and gamma oscillatory activity on the raw EEG (Fig. 11.3a). This stands in
contrast with the lower frequency patterns of propofol and ether-based volatile agents
general anesthesia with ketamine, increased
power is noted in the gamma range, particularly
near 30 Hz (Fig. 11.3b).

desmedetomidine: Lastly, dexmedetomidine induces characteristic EEG changes that
vary depending on the depth of sedation. For
example, during periods of light sedation,
increased power is noted in the low-beta range on
the spectrogram (Fig. 11.4a), which likely reflects
the presence of spindle patterns on the raw EEG
also similar to those observed during NREM
sleep (Fig. 11.4b).
With deeper levels of
dexmedetomidine sedation, increased power is
noted in the slow-delta bandwidths (Fig. 11.4c),
and slow-delta oscillations are noted on the corresponding raw EEG (Fig. 11.4d). This presents a
similar pattern to that observed with propofol and
ether-based volatile agents but without the alpha
oscillation (see Fig. 11.3)

Though these EEG patterns reflect neurophysiologic differences among anesthetic classes,
they do not necessarily provide insights into the
mechanisms behind anesthetic-induced loss of
consciousness

Despite these molecular and neurophysiologic differences, all three drug classes
have the ability to consistently induce loss of
consciousness

Specifically, loss of consciousness with
propofol, sevoflurane, and ketamine is correlated
with reduced EEG measures of frontal-to-parietal
directed connectivity [17–19], which is believed
to be a surrogate of information transfer involved
in conscious experience

In this context, processed EEG refers to the acquisition,
integration, analysis, and conversion of raw
EEG data—by a proprietary multivariable
algorithm—to a dimensionless number meant to
reflect anesthetic depth 

#Clinical Utility of Raw
and Processed EEG

Comparative trials have
not demonstrated a reduced risk of AWR with
processed EEG monitoring compared to endtidal anesthetic concentration (ETAC) monitoring protocols [23, 24], but processed EEG
monitoring does reduce the incidence of AWR
compared to routine care and monitoring

Furthermore, this may be particularly helpful during total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA),
where ETAC monitoring is not available, and the
risk of awareness may be increased [26].

There
are several reasons why processed EEG might
not be effective in reducing AWR beyond simple
ETAC monitoring. For example, anesthetists in
these studies used the processed EEG value,
rather than raw EEG data interpretation, to gauge
anesthetic depth. As such, assessment of anesthetic depth came from a processed algorithm,
rather than from direct neurophysiologic assessment. This approach may be problematic, as
index values do not take into account the different neurophysiologic properties of various anesthetics. For example, ketamine and nitrous oxide
lead to an increased EEG oscillation frequency
[27, 28], which may in turn render a higher processed EEG value.

mas q nao aprecem no eeg -> hmm n sei

Although certain EEG-based
markers such as frontal-parietal disconnection
[19, 29] and disruption of thalamocortical connectivity [12, 30] provide insights into causally
sufficient mechanisms to induce unconsciousness, the neuroscientific framework that defines
consciousness remains incompletely understood

Thus, attempts to distill a patient’s level of consciousness to a single number are not yet rooted
in complete scientific understanding

# to avoid burst supression
EEG may also be useful for appropriately titrating
anesthetic depth. For example, EEG allows practitioners to detect burst suppression, a pattern of
electrical bursts interspersed with electrical silence
(Fig. 11.5). This pattern represents a profound
depth of general anesthesia that is not observed
during sleep. Longer periods of intraoperative and
postoperative burst suppression have correlated
with postoperative delirium [31, 32], and a recent
meta-analysis of prospective trials has demonstrated a reduced risk of postoperative delirium
with BIS-guided protocols [33].

# to achieve burst supression
Alternatively,
titrating anesthetic depth to achieve burst suppression can be useful in certain circumstances,
such as cerebral aneurysm clipping, where burst
suppression may reduce the risk of ischemic
injury by reducing cerebral metabolism [34].

Thus, EEG-titrated anesthetic depth may be useful
in certain clinical scenarios, which would be valuable to anesthesiologists for improving perioperative neurologic outcomes.

*Lastly, both raw continuous (cEEG) and quantitative EEG (qEEG) findings may be useful for
the detection of cerebral ischemia in high-risk
settings*. 

Cortical voltage oscillations begin to
decrease in frequency once cerebral blood flow
(CBF) decreases below specific ischemic thresholds [35, 36]. This slowing results from ischemic
damage to neurons, which have high oxygen and
glucose requirements to maintain electrochemical gradients across cellular membranes [37].
Frequency slowing is manifested by specific
EEG patterns. 

Intraoperativel: for example,
asymmetric oscillatory slowing has been demonstrated during carotid endarterectomy (CEA),
marked particularly by irregular delta waveforms
[35, 38] (Fig. 11.6).  Also during CEA, spectral
edge frequencies and relative delta band power
are qEEG markers that have helped objectively
identify ischemia during carotid clamping [39]

Postoperatively: both cEEG and qEEG have been
shown to successfully predict cerebral ischemia
in certain pathologic settings. For example, certain features of cEEG and qEEG predict cerebral
ischemia from vasospasm after subarachnoid
hemorrhage. For cEEG, pathologic delta patterns
[40] and regional attenuation of faster frequencies—especially without delta waves present—
can help acutely diagnose cerebral ischemia [41].
Reduced total power [42] and decreased relative
alpha frequency variability [43] are qEEG markers that have demonstrated utility predicting
cerebral ischemia due to vasospasm. These quantitative markers of the EEG may be particularly
useful, as they are easier to interpret and do not
require continuous EEG surveillance and expertise to interpret the data

#Future Directions of EEG
Monitoring

#problems with anaethic depth measures
Although significant progress has been made
since the first suggestion in 1937 that EEG may
be used as an intraoperative monitoring modality
[44], the current approach to assessing anesthetic
depth is still fairly rudimentary. First, it is important to note that the most commonly used metrics
of anesthetic depth—hemodynamics and MAC—
are flawed. In the case of hemodynamics, there is
no consistent relationship between hypertension
and insufficient anesthetic depth or, perhaps more
importantly, hypotension and supratherapeutic
anesthetic depth. There are numerous determinants of blood pressure and heart rate (e.g., hypovolemia) that are independent of anesthetic
dosing or neural activity. In support of this,
numerous cases of intraoperative awareness have
been identified in the absence of frank hemodynamic changes [45]. In the case of MAC, we
have known since the 1990s that the functional
endpoint of MAC—movement—is suppressed
primarily through anesthetic effects on the spinal
cord [46–48]. Thus, MAC is not intrinsically
linked to the anesthetic effects on the brain

In order to advance the field, we need a more
sophisticated knowledge of either anesthetic
mechanisms in the brain or the neurobiology of
consciousness (or both)

There are various surrogates for connectivity and communication that can be assessed
with EEG. Techniques to assess functional connectivity (statistical interdependence between
two brain areas) include coherence and phase
synchronization. Techniques to assess
directed connectivity (a statistical interdependence that unfolds over time) 
include transfer entropy and Granger causality. Techniques
to assess effective connectivity (the identification
of a causal influence of one brain region on
another) include dynamic causal modeling

Although a complicated
literature, it has been generally found that longrange functional connections and surrogates of
communication are broken down during general
anesthesia, which presumably reflects the interrupted information synthesis that leads to the
breakdown of consciousness. This has been
found consistently across all major classes of
anesthetics [19]

Furthermore, we must
recognize that all of these techniques aim to monitor the sedative-hypnotic effects of general anesthetics. The potent and clinically important
amnesic effects are mediated by structures in the
medial temporal lobe and may be less amenable
to monitoring.

#Case Presentation

A 62-year-old man with a pertinent past medical
history significant for a right anterior cerebral
artery aneurysm presented to the operating room
for aneurysm clipping

Intraoperative EEG and
somatosensory-evoked potential (SSEP) monitoring were planned to monitor for ischemia during the procedure. Shortly after anesthetic
induction, neuromonitoring electrodes were
placed for EEG and SSEP signal acquisition, and
baseline data were obtained.

A balanced technique was employed for maintenance of anesthesia, which included propofol and sufentanil
infusions with 0.5 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of isoflurane

Shortly after this maintenance regimen was initiated, the following
pattern was noted in the EEG (Fig. 11.7). Upon
detection of burst suppression, the propofol infusion dose was decreased, and the pattern returned
to slow-wave oscillations. The EEG was used to
titrate the anesthetic depth for the rest of the case,
and burst suppression was in fact requested prior
to aneurysm clipping for ischemic neuroprotection

The aneurysm was successfully clipped, and
the rest of the case proceeded uneventfully.




#Conclusion

EEG can serve as a valuable tool for surgical
patients in a variety of clinical settings. Although
processed EEG monitors do not reduce the incidence of AWR compared with ETAC monitoring
protocols, this may be due to an incomplete understanding of EEG markers that reflect the loss of
consciousness. Although promising findings are
currently being evaluated [17, 54], a further understanding of the neural correlates of consciousness
is needed before we can confidently identify true
EEG markers of consciousness. 

Nonetheless, EEG
monitoring may play a useful role in other clinical
arenas, such as preventing deleterious neurologic
outcomes of surgery and anesthesia. EEG-guided
anesthetic titration might minimize the risk of
postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) and
postoperative delirium; multicenter trials are
needed to further explore these possibilities. The
amount of time spent in burst suppression and
deeper planes of anesthesia, as represented in our
case discussion, has correlated with cognitive dysfunction postoperatively [31, 55], and further
exploration is warranted to assess whether this has
causal significance or if the presence of burst suppression is a marker of a vulnerable brain.

Furthermore, EEG monitoring has been shown to
detect cerebral ischemia in select surgical and
intensive care unit settings. These monitoring
strategies may have the potential to detect cerebral
ischemia and prevent perioperative stroke in highrisk settings although this requires further exploration. We are presently at an exciting interface
between clinical neuroscience and anesthesiology,
as technologies for studying the brain continue to
improve, and subsequent discoveries continue to
shape our understanding of the central nervous
system. Anesthesiologists have the first-hand ability to monitor and modulate the brain with everimproving scientific understanding
