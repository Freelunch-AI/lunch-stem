Abstract | Brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) use brain activity to control external devices,
thereby enabling severely disabled patients to interact with the environment. A variety of
invasive and noninvasive techniques for controlling BCIs have been explored, most notably
EEG, and more recently, near-infrared spectroscopy. Assistive BCIs are designed to enable
paralyzed patients to communicate or control external robotic devices, such as prosthetics;
rehabilitative BCIs are designed to facilitate recovery of neural function. In this Review, we
provide an overview of the development of BCIs and the current technology available before
discussing experimental and clinical studies of BCIs. We first consider the use of BCIs for
communication in patients who are paralyzed, particularly those with locked-in syndrome or
complete locked-in syndrome as a result of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We then discuss the
use of BCIs for motor rehabilitation after severe stroke and spinal cord injury. We also
describe the possible neurophysiological and learning mechanisms that underlie the
clinical efficacy of BCIs.

Key points
• Brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) are starting to prove their efficacy as assistive and
rehabilitative technologies in patients with severe motor impairments
• BCIs can be invasive or noninvasive, and designed to detect and decode a variety of
brain signals
• Assistive BCIs are intended to enable paralyzed patients to communicate or
control external robotic devices; rehabilitative BCIs are intended to facilitate
neural recovery
• EEG-based BCIs have enabled some paralyzed patients to communicate, but
near-infrared spectroscopy combined with a classical conditioning paradigm is the
only successful approach for complete locked-in syndrome
• The combination of EEG-based BCIs with behavioural physiotherapy is a feasible
option for rehabilitation in stroke; the approach is to induce neuroplasticity and
restore lost function after stroke
• There is an urgent need for more large randomized controlled clinical trials using
invasive and noninvasive BCIs with long-term follow-ups in patients rather than
healthy populations
