notes:

da pra o car aperder a funcao da area que trasmite que ele quer mexer o braco
mas ele n perder a funcao da area do cerebro uqe planeja isso por exemplo
ai da pra pegar esse sinal, porcessar e converter em output num braco robotico por ex

neuroplasticity: por hebbian learning, da pra o pensamento do cara em querer mexer o  braco criar novas conexoes e 
ele ir recuperando a funcao. Tipo quando ele pensa, os a interface brain-computer instiga o sinal eletrico em regioes
desconnectadas pela lesao, e quando neuronios sao ativados ao mesmo tempo eles tendem a fortificar a conexao entre eles.

cada paciente se recupera de uma forma diferente.

title: Understanding potentials

url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_boSag4f8g

notes:

- action potential (what neurons use to communicate)
	
- post synptic potential (eeg tends tog et this one)
	
actions potential:
	- from dendrit eto axon terminal (travels axon)
	-at rest neuron has more negative charges than outside
	- when a neuron receives enoughpositive charge to exeed a treshold
	changes permeatibility of membrane -> more ions crossing -> spike in voltage

post synaptic potential:
	- from axon terminal to dendrit
	- when a neuron receives enoughpositive charge to exeed a treshold
	changes permeatibility of membrane -> changes the net charge of the dendrite
	- volatge can get negative or positive by receiving postive or negative charges
	- are individually smaller in amplitude, but when they sm togetherthe treshold of action potention is reached and
	a  new action potential is fired
	- ai acho que quando o sinal obtido for maior em amplitude (analogia rede neural artificial) ele fica amis tempo mandando esses action potentials e no final acaba mandando
	mas carga para os proximos neuronios
	-  uma diferencca em relacao a rede neural artifical ehq o sinal apos a funcao de ativacao no cerebro nao serve de input pra todos os neuronios em quele ele esta conectado 
	pois tem um numero finito de cargas, entao seila divide pra todos os neuronios, mas isso parece ser soh um detalhe que nao contribui em nada e soh complicaria sem necessidade

title: EEG basics - Introduction to EEG

url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMizSSOejg0&list=PLxaiR6teSdjoEZWaDWm28A9QjFN7eguAp

notes:

eeg is always relative between the eletrodes

diff amplifierer is used to write the output signals

terminlogy of eletrodes: 
	- odd/even numbers -> left/right side 
	- z stands for zero, the eletrodes exactly in the middle
	- bigger numbers are further from the z line
	- F stands for frontal (N), C for central, P for parietal (SW or SE), O stand for occipital (S)
	- Montages: different ways it can be displayed

Most common montage:
	- bipolar (anterior-posterior):
		- usualy left chains apear on top
		- chain: we move (2 by 2) along a longitude (front to back)
			- left temporal chain
			- left parisatigal chain
			- midline
			- right parisatigal chain
			- right temporal chain
	- common avarege reference:
		now we look at the difference of an eletrode and the avarege of 
		the signals of the rest of the head
	
Common eeg patterns:
	1. Eye blink: 		
		eye: has negative charge behind and positive in front
			- vertical movement: when we blink the eyeball rotates up, so we get large + signal at Fp1 and Fp2. 
			- horizontal: now ++ F7 and --F8
			- simple rule: look at first 2 channels at the temporal chains -> if you have a point were the signals
			move away from each other (positive in first and negative in second) probably the eye was rotated toward that direction

		
		obs: defletcion seen in the eeg in downwards 
	2. The alpha rythm:
		- is a normal rythm during waitfullness and is especially present when eyes are closed
		
		- although there is a range of frequencies, it is usally around 10Hz

	3. Focal Epileptiform Discharges
		- synchronus abnormal acctivity in a large # of nneurons in the cortex

		- situated in a region, possible indicator that the brain can generate ceasures
		
		- epilepsy detection

	4. Generalized Epileptiform Discharges
		- seen in patients with generalized epilepsy syndroms

		- involve the whole head at once
		
		- tipical case: 3hz generalized spike-wave discharges
		in childhod abscence epilepsy
	
Diagnostic Yield of EEG:

	suppose someaone had a ceasure:
			case              |  likelihood of finding epileptiform discharges
		- single eeg within 24h:     50%
		- //          after 24h:      20 - 55%
		- 24h eeg recording:         80-90%
		- 4 or more routine eegs:    80-90%

	why this happens?
		cant pick signals if:
		- the area of the abnormality is small
		- its far from eltrodes (deep)

notes:

polarity rules:
	sinal positivo -> input 1 negative wrt input 2
	sinal negativo -> input 1 positive wrt input 2


se a gente fazer essa analise nos channels a gente consegue chegar
a cocnlcusoes a respeito da polaridade absoluta dos eletrodos (qual eh o mais negativo ou positivo)

title: EEG basics - eeg montages

url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcW97nMLGEs&list=PLxaiR6teSdjoEZWaDWm28A9QjFN7eguAp&index=4

notes:
- Bipolar
	- anterior/posterior -> the one we talked about earlier
	- transverse -> now chains are in latitude
		- good to detect things at the center of the head
		- usefull at looking at sleep
		
- Common Reference
	- compare every eletrode to a single eletrode of reference (usually the ccenter one)
	- chains are in latitude

- Common Avarege reference 
	- compare each eletrode to the avarage of the rest of the head
	- Fp1, Fp2 and O1, O2 are excluded of the avarage because they are very suceptible to eye and head movements respectively
	- reference contamination: 
		- avarage is crap if we have something weird going on in another region that modifies the avarege to much
		- solution: laplacian montage -> compare to 4 (or 3 in lateral eletrodes) nearest neighbors
			problem: not good for broad eletrical fields because there will appear no difference in eletrodes
- Laplacian
	- just talked about

- Ipsolaterial Mastoid
	- compare to avarage of M1 (far SE), M2 (far SW)

Summary (obs: never read eeg with just one montage): 

	|       Strenght     |    Weakness
Montage	|	             |
==================================================
Bipolar 
	     versatile           not best at either focal or diffuse
==================================================
Common reference
	   not good for focal    great for broad

title: EEG basics - 5 technical issues in eeg

url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJaJDMBo54&list=PLxaiR6teSdjoEZWaDWm28A9QjFN7eguAp&index=5

notes:

	frequency bands     |  range
		Delta          <4hz
		Theta          4-7hz
		Alpha          8-13Hz
		Beta           >13Hz
		Gamma          >30Hz (can be interisting in more advanced eeg techniques,
		but wont be discussed here)

- LFF (low frequency filter - most frequencies eliminated) or HPF (High pass filter)
- HFF or LPF 
- Notch filter -> filters 60hz

Interference of external signals (noise):
	if an eletrode is poorly connected to the head -> has a higher impedence
        -> more suceptible to capturing the 60 hz external signal -> amplitude is higher
	-> consequently in coparison to the other eletrode there will be a difference in 
	the output signal, in 60hz

Representation:
	- Sensitivity:
		- realtion between mm of amplitude and voltage
		- common is 40uV of amplitude
		- ex: 7uV/mm (usually default)
	- Timebase:
		- realtion between mm of x axis and time
		- common 10-15 seconds on single page
		- ex: 30mm/sec (usually default)

title: EEG basics - Normal Awake eeg

url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17uKMFfTupY&list=PLxaiR6teSdjoEZWaDWm28A9QjFN7eguAp&index=6

notes:



alpha rythm caracteristics:
	example of eeg
	looking at single first epoch 
	starting with anterior posterior bipolar montage

	- reactive: ex: yes. alpha ryhthym with higher voltage in eye closed
 	and lower voltage with eye open
	- frequency: ex: 11hz
	
	switch to reference montage to explore amplitutude of signal,
	much easieer to get sense of absolute value of signals

	place scale legend in the graph
	- amplitutude: ex: 40-50 uV. The normal is 20-50uV in a normal awake adult
	- symetry: ex: normal symetry
		compare amplitude on the left and right side
		ex: 30-40uV on the left and 40-50 uV on the right.  
			- normal asymetry: <50% difference
			- right is often higher voltage than left
			- obs: may vary from epoch to epoch, look at other epochs to get conclusion
	-distribution: ex: posterior dominant -> occipital-maximal  
		generally is the alpha rythm is maximal in posterior head regions, specifcally occipital
	-other common patterns:
		- fairly constant in a individual:
			- can slow down in dowsiness
			- can slow down with older age
		- reaches peak frequency in adolescence/eraly adulthood


Common Normal Variants:
	1. Alpha "Squeak"
		we will remain on first epoch
		look at the period after second eye closure
		right after closure (negative peak) the frequency is much higher than the rest	
	2. Mu rhythm
		choosing another epoch
		we can see the patient is awake by:
			- prominent myogenic (muscle) artifact in the frontal and temporal regions
			suggesting active muscle tone in facial and jaw muscles which is more prominent during wakefullness
			
			- eye blinking artifacts
		we do not see alpha rythm, which is not surprising considering the patietns eyes are open

		mu rhythm:
			in the right side, peristagal region we can see a period where its maximum in F4-C4;C4-P4
			caracteristics:
				1. shape: Arch-Shaped -> resembles mu greek letter
			 	2. frequency: 8-12 hz (like alpha)
				generated by sensory motor cortex at rest
				3. prominent when limbs are at rest
				4. Blocked by movement (or thinking of moving contralateral limb)
				5. is often seen on one side or the other, but can be seen syncronously in both sides
				6. more prominent when ayes are open (probably because alpha doesnt block it)
		
	3. Lambda waveforms	
		most prminent whrn ayes are open

		we can see the patient is awake by:
			- prominent myogenic (muscle) artifact in the frontal and temporal regions
			suggesting active muscle tone in facial and jaw muscles which is more prominent during wakefullness
			
			- eye blinking artifacts
			
		lambda wavefrom:
			- ex: we can see in this epoach in the posterior head regions
			- resemble lamba greek letter
			caracteristics:
			1. phases: Diphasic (goes up and down)
			2. amplitude: Occipital Maximal
			3. polarity: Eletro-Positive
				initial postive peaks in:
					- p7-O1;p3-O1;p4-O2;p8-O2
					suggests that either the waves are eletro neagative at p's (O's being less -) or eletropositive at O's (p's being less +)
					- generally we would say that they are eltro positive in O's with lack of other materials
					
					swich to reference montage
					- O1-Avg; O2-Avg had negativ peaks suggesting O's are really eletropositive
			4. Are generated by complex visual patters
				ex: looking at dots in a ceiling tile; computer screen
	
			5. Are blocked by eye closure

title: EEG basics - eeg in normal sleep

url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LcnZJ9L3rg&list=PLxaiR6teSdjoEZWaDWm28A9QjFN7eguAp&index=7

notes: 

we wil look at the stages of normal sleep

1. Drowsiness
	- deascresed myogenic (muscle) artifact
	- slow rolling eye movments (big waves between F7 channels and F8 channels)
		while +++ (wave opens)in F7, --- in F8 (wave closes)
	- loss of normal alpha rhythm
	- increased theta activity
	- obs: there will be still some fluctuation between drawsiness and normal in the first epochs (like 2-3 min)
2. Stage 1 sleep
	lets look at posterior area channels
	- POSTS waves (positive occipital sharp transients of sleep)
		obs: have to check reference montage to get conclusion of polarity
	- sleep analagous of lambda waves
	- patients with prominant lambda often have prominent posts
	lets look at the central area channels
	- Vertex waves (late stage 1)
		- maximal in Cz,C3,C4 and --- (wave close between channels of these eletrodes)
			- we confirm it with avg-ref montage
		- are best seen in transverse montage
		- difference to lambda: have higher voltage tahn lambda waves, more spikes and do not resemble lambda
3. Stage 2 sleep
	K-complex waveform:
		-  generated by arousals and external stimulus (ex:when technologist knocks on the wall or door)
		-  preceeds arousal signals in eeg (very high frequency, "meta-oscilation", and very high voltage)
		caracteristics:
		- high voltage
		- broad contour (long duration or"low-meta-freuqency")
		- maximal frontal-central with a broad field
		- 2 or more phases
		- superimposed fast activity (high frequency)
	Sleep Spindles waveforms:
		- medium-voltage
		- central-maximal
		- durantion: 0.5-1.5 sec
		- frequency: 11-15hz (avg 12-14hz)
		- asynchronus sleep spindles: at times spindles are maximal at left at times at right
			- normal for 3-18 months babies generally (but can go up to 24 months)
			- in babies often longer duration than adults
		- asymetric spindles: inilateral or predominantly on one side

OBS: IT IS COMMON TO BE SOME FLUCTUATION BETWEEN STAGE 1 AND STAGE 2 CHARACTERISTICS

4. Slow wave sleep (stage 3/4)
	- here we do not see vertex waves, k-complex and spindles
	- we see difuse (entire head), high voltage, low frequency ("meta-frequency") delta activity with some superimposed
	higher frequency alpha and beta
	- is defined when > 20% of the sleep background looks like this
5. REM sleep
	- background is much lower voltage
	- main wavefroms are in alpha beta range, better seen in midline
	- very little or almost no muscle artifact
	- oblique eye movents: eye movements with horintal and vertical components
		- horizontal: oposite polarity in F7 (wave opens between channels) and F8 (wave closes between channels)
		- vertical: synchronus deflection in Fp1 and Fp2 (not that easy to see, low voltage)
	- rapid, chaotic (random different movements) oblique aye movements

title: EEG basics - interactal epileptiform discharges

url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KIYD1QakU8&list=PLxaiR6teSdjoEZWaDWm28A9QjFN7eguAp&index=8

notes:

1. Focal epileptiform discharges
	we will se an eeg with 2 more chains in the lateral
		- left/right inferior temporal
	ex: in the temproal chains we can see
	obs: helps a lot to decrease sensitivity here
	obs2: most epiletform discharges are eletronegative in nature
	caracteristics:
		- sharply contoured (< 200ms)
		- multiple phases
		- disrupt he background
		- after coming slow wave
		- there should be a field that makes sense
		in the example we have left anteiror charp wave:
			- inferior temporal left chain: fp1-f9 -> downward wave;f9-t9 -> no wave; t9-p9 upward wave;
				suggests that we have f9-tp as maximal eletronegative
			- regulat temporal left chain: fp1-f7 -> downward;f7-t7 -> upward; t7-p7 -> upward; p7-O1 ->upward
				suggests f7 is maximal eletronegative
		we also have a lower voltage abnormality in the right side:
		so in this page of eeg we have independent bitemporal anterior temporal sharp waves
	
2. Generalized epiletform discharges
	involve most of the head, very high voltage -> must decrease sensitivity to vizualize
	follows the same rules as before
	runs of generalized epileptiform dicharges constitutes seizures
	on the other hand, the relationship between focal and seizures is less clearly understud

title: EEG basics - Focal Slowing and Attenuation

url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCRA0B_q8CE&list=PLxaiR6teSdjoEZWaDWm28A9QjFN7eguAp&index=9

notes: 

- Location: region, hemisphere
	
- Frequency: Theta, delta, mixed

- Continuos or intermitent

- Rhythmic or polymorphic

1. scan through the page second-by-second
2. sistematically compare analagous head regions

ex: in the first second, we saw that in the left temporal there is a hint of a theta or delta wave
which we dont see in the right. In seconds 3-5 we ccan see more of this
	- focal intermittent polymorphic left temporal theta-delta activity
	- interpretation: mild nonspecific focal cerebral dysfunction
switching to avg reference montage
	- in seconds 3-5 we can clearlt see medium voltage theta/delta waves in the left side that 
	are not seen in the right side
	-takes time, but with experience gets faster
in another pacient we see the differences, but they occur continuosly in the right hemisphere (but more in the temporal right)
	 - continuos polymorphic theta and delta right hemisphere maximal right temporal
	 - suggests significant focal cerebral disfunction: 
	 - continuos slow:
		- stroke;tumor;other structural abnormality;post-ictal (after seizure)
in another pacient we see continuos slowing in left hemisphere, but with a clear frequency pattern
	- lateralized rhythmic delta activity (LRDA) or temporal rhythmic intermittent delta activity (TIRDA)	
		is more strongly associated with seizures than polymorphic delta activity
in another pacient we see 
	- attenuation of fast activity on the left (we dont see alpha activity in the left)
	- continuos polymorphic delta activity on the left
	first cconclusion: focal cerebral/cortical dysfunction in the left hemisphere
	- decreased muscle activity in the right temporal chain
	- symmetrical function of forehead muscles
	- irregularly iregular EKG -> patient could be in atrofibrilation
	conclusion: embolic left hemispheric inarction due to atrialfibrilation producing
	right upper neuron facial weakness (because it is more on temporal than frontal)
in another pacient we see
	- polimorphic slowing in the left hemisphere, particularly in the temporal region
	- in the left posterior region we see higher voltage in the alpha and beta range
		- this is a breach artifact: when there is a openedregion in the skull next to an eletrode
			- makes it easier to high frequencies pass skull (which is a low pass filter) so
			we see in the eeg higher amplitude

title: EEG basics - Diffuse (Generalized) Slowing and Periodic Discharges

url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_2xu7oDFT0&list=PLxaiR6teSdjoEZWaDWm28A9QjFN7eguAp&index=10

notes:

1. Diffuse (Generalized) Slowing

- often arbitrarily graded as 'mild,moderate or severe'

- indicators of severe dysfunction:
	- frequency (theta vs delta)
	- organization (i.e. anterior-posterior gradient)
	- continuity
	- reactivity

- rythmic or polymorphic

lets see first pacient eeg

- we see significant differencce in theta/delta in the left and right hemisphere
- we see more muscle artifact in the right side, but that can fluctuate from time-to-time and be asymetrical
in any given patient
- no difference between anterior and posterior (no anterior-posterior gradient)
as opposed to normal eeg where we see normal alpha rythm maximal in posterior
- predominantly theta activity
- eeg interpretation: mild-moderate diffuse background slowing
- clinical correlate: mild-moderate nonspecific diffuse cerebral dysfunction

if the patient had predomintantly delta activity it would be worse
if the patient had discontinuos background even worse
	- eeg interpretation: "burst-supression" or discontinuos pattern
	- clinical interpretation: nonspecific severe cerebral dysfunction
and if we see no singals:
	- eeg interpretation: diffuse background attenuation or supression
	- clinical interpretation: nonspecific very severe cerebral dysfunction

2. Periodic Discharges

- generalized periodic discharges (GPDs)
	lets see our first patient
	- we see regurlarly sharp discharges ocurring at 1Hz
	- they are maximal in frontal regions bilateraly
	- we can see 3 pahses in the waveform of the discharge
	- eeg interpretation: generalized periodic dicharges with triphasic morphology ("triphasic waves")
	- clinical significance: diffuse cerebral dysfunction metabolic encephalopathy versus increased epileptic potential
	
	second patient
	- no discharges in the begging of epoch
	- when dicharges start, muscle artifact also starts in temporal chains
	- could be stimulus-indiced GPDs or SI-GPDs, which is a common finding 

	third patient
	- background is diffusely supressed with minimal activity in between discharges
	- dicharges are very high voltage and very sharp
	- eeg interpretation: GPDs on a sppressed background
	- clinical significance: 
		- diffuse cerebral disfunction
		- diffuse cortical irritability

	fourth patient
	- we see regurlarly much less sharp discharges ocurring at 1 Hz
	- eeg interpretation: "Blunt" GPDs and mild diffuse slowing
	- clinical significance: 
		- mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction
		- mild diffuse cortical irritability

- lateralized periodic discharges (LPDs)
also known as periodic lateralized eplieptiform discharges (PLEDs)
	- clear disctiontion on the left/right sides
	- on the left: 
		- sharp, complex, high voltage, occuring at 1-2Hz dicharges
	- eeg interpretation: Left sided laterilized periodic discharges (LPDs)
	- clinical significance: 
		- focal cortical hyperexcitability on left
		- increased risk of seizures from left hemisphere
		- common clinical correlates:
			1. acute stroke
			2. HSV encephalitis 
			3. In association with status epilepticus in estabileshed epilepsy 
		-  important: when you see it, continue to record to make sure they do not develop eltrographic seizures
		- seizures: the pattern is to the frequency of dicharges to become much higher, higher voltage
		and evolves in complexity
		-  at the end of the seizure we see re-emargence of the LPDs
		
- bilateral independent periodic dicharges (BIPDs)
also known as bilateral indepenndent periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (BILEDs)
	-  dicharges of left are independent of discharges of right side
	- eeg interpretation: bilateral independent periodic dicharges (BIPDs or BIPLEDs)
	- clinical significance: 
		- focal cortical hyperexcitability bilaterally
		- severe cerebral dysfunction
		- dysfunction of left-right connections
	- are uncommon but indicate severe cerebral dysfunction

title: EEG basics - eeg workshop - recognizing seizures in a comatose patient

url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQ8K0RsVeO8&list=PLxaiR6teSdjoEZWaDWm28A9QjFN7eguAp&index=11

notes:

- first study baseline of patient

- tip: start with the first arfifact-free page

arfiacts:
	- muscle
	- 60hz
	- chest percussion(very hard to notice). nest noted with video input
	- pulse
		- waveform pulsed correlate directly with EKG pulse
	- eye blink 
	- eyelid fluttering (hard also, looks rythmic, high voltage)
	
features of absnormaities (analogy of eeavesdropping couple):
	obs: seizures can also have slower waveform patters

	1. Change from background
		a. Screaming match
		b. Silent treatment
	2. Sustained
	3. Rhythmic
	4. *Evolution

first question to ask when we see an abnorality in eeg:	
	is there a clinical correlate (what is the patient doing at the time of the pattern)?
	
clinical vs subclinical 
	ex: for seizures it is easier because we have an obvious clinical correlate
	however for ex: a comatose patient doesnt show clinical amanifestations so we have to depende on the eeg
	and we see in the eeg of this patient ictal waveforms ocurring at low frequency (a periodic dicharge with big interdischarge interval), is it a seizure?

what is an eletrographic seizure?
	an abnormal, sustained (> 10 sec), ryhtmic(no interdischarge interval) eletrical discharge [that evolves]

waht defines Evolution?
	any one of these (having more being more definitive):
		1. frequency: two consecutive changes oin the same direction of at leat 0.5 hz (ex: 2hz ->1.5hz -> 1hz)
		2. morphology: two consecutive changes (obs: exclude amplitude or "sharpness" alone, because they are soft indicators, but together become strong indicator)
		3. location: spread to two additional leads

logical tree:

	1. does the aptient have > 10sec rythmic pattern that differs from the background?
		Yes -> 2. ; 
		No -> No seizure -> END;
	2. it is >= 3hz?
		Yes -> seizure -> END;
		No -> 3.
	3. does it evolve?
		Yes -> seizure -> END;
		No -> 4.
	4. If clinical suspicion for seizures consider trial of rapid-acting AED (e.g benzodiazepine)
		Did the patient imporve?
			Yes -> seizure -> END;
			No -> no seizure -> END;

what does NCSE (non convolsive status epilepticus), which means no clinical manifestation, look like?
	any of these:
		- occupies >50% of record
		- > 10 min

almost but no quite?
	- B(I)RDs
		- (< 10 sec)
	- Artifacts
	- "Possible NCSE"
	- The "ictal-interactical continuum"

title: EEG basics - eeg minilesson - smal sharp spikes

url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyOv1RFT2ak&list=PLxaiR6teSdjoEZWaDWm28A9QjFN7eguAp&index=12

notes:

lets see an example of an patient
	- we can see he is awake because of bilateral posterior dominant rythm, symmetrical of aprox 9hz
	- we see attenuation if this rythm with eye opening and augmentation with eye closing
	- patient is possibly drawsy because of the slow rolling aye movments seen in the temporal chains (low meta-frequency, large waves)
	- then we start to sse loss in muscle artifact and emergence of some theta rhythm
	- also see mild slowing and anterior migration of the psoterior dominant rythm -> patient is now drowsy
	-  we see small sharp spikes in temporal region, we change to reference montage to see bettter
		- low voltage (<50 uV )and small duration, or sharp (<50msec)
		- note: these are easiley mistaken for artifact of the ekg
	- going forward we see also some sharp, hight voltage temporal maximal spikes, with 3 phases, follewed by slow wave
		this represents an *epilefiform dicharge

Epiletform discharges:
	1. Sharply Contoured
	2. Multiple phases
	3. Field that makes sense
	4. After-coming slow wave
	5. Disrupt the background

summary of smal sharp spikes
	- small
	- sharp
	- occur during sleep
	- temporal (broad field)
	- simple -> 2 phases
	- not epileptic

summary of focal sharp spikes
	- anywhere
	- any state

notes:

- it is important to distinguish from epileptiform dicharges, to not diagnose someone with epilepsy wrongly

lets see a patient a sleep
	- we know the patient is a sleep because there is no muscle artifact 
	and we can see some sleep transisents, specifcally POSTS
	Wickets:
		-  if we look at the left temproal region, we see run of sharp discharges occuring at aprox 7-8hz 
		with suttle increase and decrease in amplitutude over the run
		-  they have a simple biphasic morphology
		- can be seen independentlyin both temporal regions
		- dont disrupt the background, and dont have slow wave after
		-  maximal in mid-temporal region (T7/T8)
		- occur during drawsiness and sleep
		- can also occur individually 
		- are not associated with epilepsy

notes:

- normal sign, not associated with abnormalitites
- relatively rare

lets see a patient:
	- we can see hes asleep because:
		- no PDR (posterior dominant alpha rhythm)
		- No muscle artifact
		- Emergence of diffuse intermitent theta
	14/6s (or tenoid) bursts:
		- have broad field
		- dificult to localize on ant/post montage
		- we will switch to avg ref montage
			- waveforms are best seen in right posterior temporal region
			- but becaus of ref contamination of the broad filed, there is aparent envolvement of
			the left temporal region
			- contralateral mastoid montage is the best in this case
			- sequence of 14 hz followed by 6 hz waveform
			- most common in young people
			- biggest spikes are downward -> therefore is +++

title: eeg on stroke patients

url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTKI5zWlRHI

notes:

 - eeg is common to diagnose epilepsy and brain death

 -  we will use 256 eletrodes

 - partial  least sqaures model (PBS model)
	- software that is able to interpret the variance in eeg recordings and quantify into a graph

 - paper: utility of eeg in patients with acute stroke

in ipsiolesional and contralesional:
	- delta waves have positive correlation with lesion, and beta waves have negative correlation

obs: eeg is easy accesible

title: triage of stroke patients in the ambulance with eeg

url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXOSmM_GRS0

notes:

ischemic stroke:
	- poor blood flow  to distal brain areas
	- ischemic (our focus): blockage of blood vessel
	- hemorragic: bleeding of blood vessel

treatment of ischemic stroke:
	- large vessel occlusion -> intra-arterial thrombectomy (IAT) which is better, and intravenous trombolysis
		(IAT needs hospital with EVT(endovascular treatment), fewer)
	- non LVO -> intravenous trombolysis

why trat early:
	the area affected (infarct core) gets larger and larger -> within 12h it is very severe
	
core: infarcted tissue (beyond recovery)
penumbra: viable cerebral tissue (blood supply by collaterals)

gold standard for large vessel occlusion ischemic stroke: Computed Tomography (CT)

only 7% of pacients have LVO

one solution would be to have a ct in ambulance
	problems: expensive, need training, radiation

wet eletrode eeg:
	streghts: excellent eltrical contact, good signal quality
	weaknesses: long setup times, skjn abrasion, eletrode paste, experiencced users

dry eletrode eeg (solution chosen):
	streghts: quick setup times, no skin abrasion, no eletrode paste, all trained users
	weaknesses: decreased eletrical contact, lower signal quality

stroke signal:
	- signal becomes predomintantly lower frequency than before
	- increase in delta activity in the ischemic tissue (core)
	- slowing, attenuation or loss of the alpha + beta background activity (unilateral or biateral)
	- data absed on records of 12h after stroke

there is little data of eeg in stroke patients before t = 12h
no data before t = 1h

erani, stroke, 2020:
	- using deep learning with clinical + eeg gave good results
	- just with eeg didnt give good specificity and auc

singal quality (artifacts)
	movement:
		- huge spikes
	muscle:
		- very high frequency superimposed on the background
	bad electrode-skin contact:
		- can produce low frequncy complex waveforms or just dead line
		- this can be similiar to stroke signals, hard to tell

singal quality challenges:
	- loose cap fit
	- hair type (people with a lot of hair)
	- no visible access to eletrodes
	- no impedence check (yet, thwy will start implementing)
		-  to be shure the impedence is correct

signal quality is sufficient for anlysis in 80% of the data.

title: EEG in ASD (Autism): Can Brain Waves Help Us Predict Treatment Response and Outcomes?

url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txsMbQc6Xfk

notes:

- eeg signal are produce by firing of a lot of neurons together

- using high desnsity eeg (aprox 120 eletrodes)

- we have in the eeg: ocillations and event realted potentilas (ERP)

event related potentilas (ERP)
	we can see how the brain responds to stimulus
	we can caracterize by latency, amplitude, location

why eeg?
	- provides information about perception, cognition, and different brains states
	- exquisite temporal resolution
		- can obtain info about processing in real time (with accuracy in order of milliseconds)
	- sheds light on neural processes and brain development
		- genes -> brain -> behaviour

can eeg biomarkers inform behaviour/ability?

can eeg biomarkers characterize brain changes over time and with treatment?

goal : can we use eeg biomarkers to better inform treatment options and to presict treatment response?

ex: when shown objects autistic kids have erp reponse of a tipical kid to faces

- posterior alpha power, and posterior gamma power good biomarkers for identifying Autism

obs: kids were placed seeing bubles in awake rest

obs: visual cortex is in the posterior

treatment showed trend between asd kids and normal kids (with respect to alpha, gamma power) from autistic pattern to 
normal pattern

waveform for visual stimulus, expected vs unexpected:

- first goes downward (N1, recognition of the stimulus), then upwards (P300, represents attention and surprise)
	- in or controls group we expect to see: bigger n1 to expected stimulis and bigger p300 to unexpected
	- kids with autism have inverted response in P3 

in autistic:
	- p3 ampltitude diff corr with adaptive social function
	- n1 ampltitude diff corr with iq

in controls:
	- no correlations, but very little variability in phenotype

in tis case treatment showed increase in inverted P3 in autistic kids, an consequently better social skills and iq

title: Use of EEG as a Biomarker for Diagnosis and Outcomes in Neurodevelopmental Disorders

url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkZ9lGrzCYA

notes:

// EEG Biomarkers of autism risk //

## Use of biomarkers:
- to use as endo-(intermediate) phenotype...
	- to link brain function with underlying genetics
	- to examine functions that lie "beneath the surface", out of range behavioral assays
-to shed light on mechanism
	- to use transationally (e.g. mouse to human)
- to use as predictor and "characterizer"...
	- to distiguish those at high or low risk for a disorder
	- to predict who develops a disorder
	- to predict severity of a disorder
- to use as an moderator/mediator to outcome in clinical trials
	- to stratify a sample in a clinical trial
	- to examine response to treatment
	- to shed light on neural/biological mechanisms underlying tretment efficacy


## Considerations

can the measures get us close to the mechanisms?
	- underlying disorder
	- that mediate response to tretment?

can the measures be tolerated by most infants/children?
Expense?
Replicable across labs?
Replicable across individuals?
When used longitudinally (over time in one individual), can they distinguish changes in
the disorder from developmental changes?

goal: early detection of autism
tool : cognitive science

focusing on brain: since changes in the brain precede changes in behaviour, and thus can be done much earlier

todays focus: infants at risk for autism bt having older brothre with autism

to date, no behavioral measure in infants <1year reliably predicts autism outcome (exception: some evidence for eye tracking for <1/2year)

power spectrum = espectro de freq

examining eeg though the first year of a baby is highly predictive of autism appearence

the brain is an adaptively built complex system
(struccturally and functionally)
	1. brain structure is complex
	2. signals produced are compex

and these are correlated:
	complex heirachical networks produce nonlinear, chaotic time series ...
	that contain info about network structure

autism classification & symptom severity estimate using SVM (whith features extracted from time series)

summary

- there are now sophisticate ways to capture the non-linear dynamics of the eeg

- Bosl et al. (2018) have shown that is possible to predict from 3-month eeg which infants will:
	- be diagnosed with autism at 36 months 
	- severity of disorder
- combined with our ealier work using conventional approaches to eeg analysis, this opens the door to the development
of predictive biomarkers

questions for the future
	- regarding intervention, do we treat the biomarker or the disorder (clinical evidence) ?


// EEG Biomarkers in children with "Fragile X" syndrome //

the need:
	- biological markers associated with functionality significant
	outcome measures (languages, cognition, behaviour) to:
		- be used in trails to monitor improvement
		- imporve our understanding of the pathophysiology

experiment: kids awake without stimulus, just looking at an scrren saver

fragile x people showed more power in higher frequencies (increased gamma power) 
in frontal and auditory cortex

how to measure gamma power
	FOOOF: fitting oscillations and on over f (1/f = T)
	periodic component: E[signal above 1/f in the freq interval - singal below] -> they think relates to the oscillations per se
	aperiodic component: E[singal below 1/f in the frq interval] -> they think this component relates to noise or E/I (excitation/inhibition) Balance
	then we get aperiodic adjusted power spectrum	

increased power in the beta/gamma badn is due to:
	- aperidiodic power spectrum: decreased slope of aperiodic component
	- aperidiodic adjusted power spectrum:increassed amplitutude/shift of aprox 30hz peak

conclusions:
	- gamma power associated with fragile x development

	- in fragile x people the higher hte gamma power , the higher were the language skills develpment

	- aperiodic strongly correlated with language ability

	-  no associations with other clinical measures

	- increased E/I - maybe its good?

title: tDCS, EEG and Motor Rehabilitation - Neuroelectrics webinar featuring Mar Cortes

url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ITnfgYQHRg

notes:

adaptive plasticity :incomplete recovery of mmotor function 
maladaptive plasticity: pain spasticity

after injury, stimulation of the nervous system cana augment plasticity of
spares or latent circuits through focal modulation
	- repetitive transcanial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)
	- transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)
	- Theta burst stimulation (TBS)
	- Paired associative stimulation (PAS)

	- Trans-spinal direct current stimulation (tsDCS)
	- Epidural stimulation
	- Spinal associative stimulation (SAS)

	- Functional eletrical stimulation
	- Transcutaneous eletrical nerve stimulation (TENS)
	- Moto skill training

Brain stimulation and sroke rehabilitation
	- in stroke we have typically one affected hemisphere and one not
	- the affected hemipsphere presents decreased excitability after stroke
	- the unnefected hemisphere presents increased excitability after stroke
	- the goal has been to equalize the sides
	- to increase excitability in affected hemisphere:
		- HF-rTMS
		- iTBS
		- Anodal tDCS
	- to decrease excitability in uneffected hemisphere:
		- LF-rTMS
		- cTBS
		- Cathodal tDCS


Neuroplacticity: the basis of motor recovery
	The ability of the nervous system to respond to instrinsic or extrinsic stimuli
	by reorganizing its structure, function and connections
	It can be triggered by injury an/or activity/training

Active training enhances neuroplacticity and results in reorganization of cortical maps

Key factors for motor recovery duraing training:
	- Intensity
		- repetitions
		- duration
		- distribution/frequency
		- effort
		- difficulty
	- Psychological Factors
		- motivation
	- Manner
		- task segmentatoin
		- specificity/functionality
		- variablity
		- initiation
		- shaping
	- Information
		- instructions
		- feedback


There is a need for novel approaches
	-tDCs (modulates cortical excitability); VR; Sensor tech; robotics


read and write the brain:
	cloud -> monitor (eeg) -> predict and personalize -> stimulate (tDCS)

but tDCS needs to be a coadjuvant motor rehabilitation strategy


why do some people respond and others dont?
	
cortical integraity, assesses by TMS, is a predictor
of clinicaly meaningfull response to itensive arm therapy in chronic stroke

how do we optimize brain stimulation?
	- how much? Dose (# sessions)
	- how long? long term adaptation
	- who? subject selection
	- where? targeted brain region
	- when? timing in combined therapies

precision rehabilitation
	- reponders vs no responders. Predictors of recovery
	- interaction of brain and spinal placticity
	- neurophysiology to guide rehabilitation
	- development of new objective (and more sensitive) outcome measures
	- multidisciplinary teams


AI could be used to personalize stimulation protocols to optimize their effectiveness ?
