Disclaimer: there are ASICs that dont fall into neither of these categories, like autonomous car computing hardware (Embedded with High Computing Capacity)
, but these are special cases tailored for specific applications.

Types of Edge Devices:

1. Browser Devices:

1.1 Higher Computing capacity - Servers close to client application (Typically not the focus when talking about Edge ML):
- example: cloud machines
- internet: good connection
- OS: yes
- deployment: over the internet (fecthes image from image registry)
- approches: runs multiple containers
- energy: power supply

1.2 High Computing Capacity - User devices (Federeted Learning is strong here):
- examples: Mobile phones, user pc
- internet: good connection
- OS: yes
- deployment: over the internet 
	- Code running on the browser: webserver sends code inside JS
	- Code running as application: user gets apk through app store
- approches:
	- Code running on the browser: the user doesnt need to install anything (Web Assembly)
	- Code running as application: the user needs to install app
- energy: good battery

2. Embedded Devices (Tiny ML):

2.1 Medium Computing Capacity: 
- examples: rasberry pi alikes
- internet: connection is generally poor
- OS: yes
- deployment: over the internet (fecthes image from image registry)
- approaches: runs multiple containers
- energy: power supply

2.2 Low Computing Capacity: 
- examples: arduino alikes, smart watches, etc
- internet: may or not may not have connection, connection is generally poor
- OS: no
- deployment: manually send code to RAM via USB port
- approaches: runs single process bare-metal
- energy: bad battery
