### Matching surfaces that share a parameterization

For example, consider if a surface $X$ is given with a parameterization so that
each point on $X$ can be written as a function of parameters $u$ and $v$,
$\x(u,v) ∈ X$. If $Y$ is another surface produced by the same parameterization
($\y(u,v) ∈ Y$), then we can think of $Y$ as a _deformation_ of $X$ (or
vice-versa). Each point $\y(u,v)$ on the surface $Y$ has a natural
corresponding point $\x(u,v)$ on $X$ via the parameters $u$ and $v$.

![The surface of a Beetle is _deformed_ into a new surface. The
parameterization of the original surface allows us to identify the
corresponding points on the deformed surface.
[image source](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/)
](images/beetle-deformation.png)

A very natural way to _measure_ the difference between these two surfaces
_aggregate_ the distance between each pair of corresponding points. For
example, we could [integrate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral) this
distance over the parametric domain
([w.l.o.g.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Without_loss_of_generality) let's say
valid values are $u,v ∈ (0,1)$):

\\[
D_2(X,Y) = \sqrt{ ∫_0^1∫_0^1 ‖\x(u,v) - \y(u,v)‖² \;du\;dv }
\\]

This measure will be zero if the surfaces are the same for any choice of
parameters $u$ and $v$. The measure $D_2(X,Y)$ could large if every point on
$Y$ is _slightly_ deformed or if a few bad points are deformed a lot. This
distance is the [L²
norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics)#Infinite-dimensional_case)
of the magnitude of the _displacement_ from $X$ to $Y$ (or vice-versa):

\\[
D_2(X,Y) = \sqrt{ ∫_0^1∫_0^1 d(u,v)² \;du\;dv }, \quad \text{ and } \quad d(u,v) = ‖\x(u,v) -
\y(u,v)‖
\\]

We can directly measure the _maximum_ distance between corresponding
points, the $L^∞$ norm:

\\[
D_∞(X,Y) = \lim_{p→∞} \sqrt[p]{∫_0^1∫_0^1 d(u,v)^p \;du\;dv } = \sup\limits_{u,v ∈
(0,1)} ‖\x(u,v) - \y(u,v)‖,
\\]

where $\sup$ takes the
[supremum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infimum_and_supremum) (roughly the continuous math
analog of the [maximum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxima_and_minima)).

The measure $D_∞$ will also be exactly zero if the surfaces are the same.

#### Triangle meshes

On the computer, we can store an explicit surface as a triangle mesh. Triangle
meshes have an _implicit_ parameterization: each triangle can be trivially
and independently mapped to the unit triangle, via its [barycentric
coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barycentric_coordinate_system#Barycentric_coordinates_on_triangles).

Triangle meshes also afford an immediate analog of deformation: moving each
vertex of the mesh (without change the mesh combinatorics/topology).

So if $\V_X ∈ \R^{n × 3}$ represents the vertices of our surface $X$ with a set
$F$ of $m$
triangular faces and  $\V_Y ∈ \R^{n × 3}$ the vertices of deformed surface $Y$,
then we can rewrite our measure $D_2$ above as a sum of integrals over each
triangle:

\\[
∑\limits_{\{i,j,k\} ∈ T}  \sqrt{ ∫_0^{1-u} ∫_0^1 
\left\|
\underbrace{\left(u \v_x^i + v \v_x^j + (1-u-v) \v_x^k\right)}_\x
-
\underbrace{\left(u \v_y^i + v \v_y^j + (1-u-v) \v_y^k\right)}_\y
\right\|^2 \;du\;dv }
\\]

> **Note:** The _areas_ of the triangles in our mesh may be different. So this
> measure may be thrown off by a very large triangle with a small difference
> and may fail to measure a very small triangle with a large difference. We'll
> learn how to account for this, later.

Unfortunately, in many scenarios we do not have two co-parameterized surface or
a simple per-vertex mesh deformation. Instead, we may have two arbitrary
surfaces discretized with different meshes of different
topologies. We will need a measure of difference or distance between two
surfaces that does not assume a shared parameterization.

### (undirected) Hausdorff distance

To form a [metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_(mathematics)) in the
mathematical sense, a distance measure should be symmetric: distance from $X$
to $Y$ equals distance from $Y$ to $X$. Hausdorff distance is defined as the
maximum of directed Haurdorff distances:

\\[
D_{H}(X,Y) = \max \left[ D_{\overrightarrow{H}}(X,Y)\ , \ D_{\overrightarrow{H}}(Y,X) \right].
\\]

Unlike each individual directed distance, the (undirected) Hausdorff distance
will measure zero [if and only
if](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if) the [point
set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space#Balls.2C_spheres.2C_and_hypersurfaces)
of the surface $X$ is identical to that of $Y$.

![](images/hausdorff-distance-2d.png)

#### Hausdorff distance between triangle meshes

On the computer, surfaces represented with triangle meshes (like any point set)
admit a well-defined Hausdorff distance between one-another. Unfortunately,
computing _exact_ Hausdorff distance between two triangle meshes remains a
difficult task: existing exact algorithms are prohibitively inefficient.

We do not know [_a
priori_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_priori_and_a_posteriori) which
point(s) of each triangle mesh will end up determining the maximum value. It is
tempting, optimistic, but ultimately incorrect to assume that the _generator_
points will be one of the vertices of the triangle mesh. Consider if a triangle
$t$ connected corners at $(1,1,0)$, $(1,0,1)$ and $(0,1,1)$ and $B$ was a mesh
with two triangles, the first connecting $(0,0,0)$, $(1,0,1)$ and $(1,1,0)$ and
the second connecting $(0,0,0)$, $(0,1,1)$ and $(1,1,0)$. The corners of $t$
also appear as vertices of $B$, so clearly their respective vertex-to-mesh
distances are zero, yet the maximum minimum distance from $t$ to $B$ is clearly
non-zero (it is $\sqrt{3}/3$).

![The directed Hausdorff distance from the orange triangle $A$ to
the blue, two-triangle mesh $B$ is non-zero (generated by red segment), but the
distance from each corner of $A$ to $B$ is
zero.](images/hausdorff-counterexample-3d.jpg)

One might also optimistically, but erroneously hope that by considering the
symmetric Hausdorff distance one of the _generator_ points must lie on a vertex
of $A$ or of $B$. Unfortunately, this only follows for convex shapes.

![The directed Hausdorff distance _to_ the blue "alligator" shape
in 2D _from_ its orange convex hull is generated by non-vertex points. Since
the symmetric Hausdorff distance is the maximum of this and the smaller
distance from the blue shape to the orange shape, it is also generated by these
non-vertex points.](images/hausdorff-non-convex-2d.png)

## Integrated closest-point distance

## Symmetric matching distance

We can similarly define a symmetric distance by _summing_ the two directed
distances:

\\[
D_{C}(X,Y) = 
D_{\overrightarrow{C}}(X,Y) +
D_{\overrightarrow{C}}(Y,X) = 
\sqrt{\ ∫\limits_{\x∈X} ‖\x - P_Y(\x) ‖² \;dA }+
\sqrt{\ ∫\limits_{\y∈Y} ‖\y - P_X(\y) ‖² \;dA }.
\\]


## Unconstrained ICP

If we place no restrictions or
[constraints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constrained_optimization) on the
transformation $T: \R³ → \R³$, then there are many [trivial
solutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triviality_(mathematics)) to
minimizing $E_{\overrightarrow{C}}(T(X),Y)$. For example, we could simply
define $T$ so that every point $\x$ gets mapped to its closest point on $Y$:
$T(\x) := P_Y(\x)$. This would clearly induce $E_{\overrightarrow{C}}=0$.
Actually, we could get zero energy even if we define $T$ to map _all_ points on
$X$ to the same _arbitrary_ point on $Y$: $T(\x) := \y$.
