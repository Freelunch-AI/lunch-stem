Open MPI (based on Message Passing Interface) is also a programming platform, but instead provides one the ability to parallelize code 
over a (non-)homogenous distributed system (e.g., a supercomputer). For instance, it's possible to parallelize an entire program over 
a network of computers, or nodes, which communicate over the same network. Since these nodes are essentially computers, they have their 
own memory layout and their own set of cores (see OpenMP description). Communication between nodes, when compared to shared memory systems, 
can be difficult and is usually expensive.
