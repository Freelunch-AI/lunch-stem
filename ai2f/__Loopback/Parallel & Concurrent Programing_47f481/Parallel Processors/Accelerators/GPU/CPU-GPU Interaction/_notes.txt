"Typically CPU and GPU communicate over the PCI Express bus. (It’s not technically a bus but a point to point connection.) From the perspective of software running on the CPU, these days, that communication is typically in the form of memory-mapped IO. The GPU has registers and memory mapped into the CPU address space using PCIE. A write to a particular address generates a message on the PCIE bus that’s received by the GPU and produces a write to a GPU register or GPU memory.
The GPU also has access to system memory through the PCIE bus. Typically, the CPU will construct buffers in memory with data (textures, vertices), commands, and GPU code. It will then store the buffer address in a GPU register and ring some sort of “doorbell” by writing to another GPU register. The GPU (specifically, the GPU command processor) will then read the buffers from system memory, and start executing the commands. Those commands can include, for example, loading GPU shader programs into shader memory and triggering the shaders to execute those shaders."
