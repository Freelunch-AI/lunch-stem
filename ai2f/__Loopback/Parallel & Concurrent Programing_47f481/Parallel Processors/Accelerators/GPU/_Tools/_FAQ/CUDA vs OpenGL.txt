Chief Differences:

1. OpenGL is a graphics LIBRARY which is used for visualization, gaming and etc., where as CUDA is a programming language which could be utilized 
for general purpose compute intensive tasks such as image processing, machine learning.

2. OpenGL works on all CPU, integrated Graphics Processors like Intel HD graphics and all GPU (AMD, NVIDIA etc) cards, where as CUDA is proprietary 
language by NVIDIA for NVIDIA graphics cards.

3. Most important: The code that executes on hardware (GPU) is already written in openGL implementations and programmer is supposed to call the 
functions appropriately, where as in CUDA, programmer writes the codes which executes on the hardware.
