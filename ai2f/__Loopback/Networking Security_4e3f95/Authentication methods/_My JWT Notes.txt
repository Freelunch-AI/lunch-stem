JWT payload only stores claims of the user. Therefore doesnt store credentials (password). Besides being totally insecure, 
it wouldnt make sense to put password in there even if it was secure. Because the authentication is already done by descrypting the signature
with the public key and checking if the payload == signature after decryption.

JWT is a type of bearer token. 

WIl typically go in Authorization header. But can also go inside Cookie header 
(and therefore be stored in cookie file in browser and added to any request as header automatically by the browser)
or as query param, or inside request body.

Use Cookies istead of JWT (or at least never put JWT in local storage): https://medium.com/kanlanc/heres-why-storing-jwt-in-local-storage-is-a-great-mistake-df01dad90f9e
