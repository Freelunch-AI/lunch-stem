A* search for the Hanoi problem, with any initial condition.
</h1>

<p align="center">
    This project is part of the Artifical Intelligence Course from the department of Mechatronics of the University of São Paulo (USP). The goal was to develop, in Prolog, the A* algorithm that solves the problem the Hanoi problem. The Hanoi problem: 5 diks are distrubuted across 3 poles, respecting the constraint that a disk cannot be on top of a smaller disk. The problem is to find the optimal sequence of actions, for any initial condition, so that, in the end, all disks are stacked at the destination pole.
