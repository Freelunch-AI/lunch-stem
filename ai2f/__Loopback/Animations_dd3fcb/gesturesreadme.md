If you want to play with the API but don't feel like trying it on a real app, you can run the example project. Clone the repo, go to the Example/ folder and run:

  yarn install
If you are running on ios, run pod install in the ios folder

Run yarn start to start the metro bundler

Run react-native run-android or react-native run-ios (depending on which platform you want to run the example app on).

You will need to have an Android or iOS device or emulator connected as well as react-native-cli package installed globally.
