docker bridge and host networks != vm bridge and host only netwrks (although share similar concepts):

docker:

bridge: creates separate nwtwork, each container receivera public IP address, connects to host via the bridge
that acts as a NAT, and host acts as a router

host: container can only be accessed by host, doesnt have an IP, running on a host port


vm:

NAT: vms are isolated from one another, each vm has its own NAT that connects to the host, which acts as a router

bridge: receives public IP like it was another machine connected on host LAN, one NAT for all the vm's and connects to the host, which acts as a router

host-only: only accessible to host, creates isolated LAN with the host included
